Trees play a significant importance in our environment and human well-being. Trees provide us fresh water to drink, air to breathe, shade, and food for humans, animals, and plants. Trees give habitats for various species of fauna and flora, materials for construction, and places of spiritual, cultural, firewood for cooking, and heat and recreational importance. Trees are so essential for the global environment and the health of the species that live there. And they want our unconditional care and protection.

<br><br>Trees also play an important part in every community. Streets, parks, playgrounds, and backyards are filled with trees that form a peaceful, aesthetically pleasing atmosphere. Trees enhance our quality of life by bringing natural elements and wildlife habitats into urban environments. We collect under the cool shade they provide during outdoor activities with family and friends. Several areas are also the home of quite old trees which serve as historic landmarks and a great reference of town pride.
